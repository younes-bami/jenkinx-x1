# Custom Jenkins Image

This project creates a custom Docker image based on the [Jenkins X image for Jenkins](https://github.com/jenkins-x/jenkins-x-image) which then adds a number of plugins defined in the [plugins.txt](plugins.txt)

See the [documentation on configurating a custom Jenkins docker image](https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/config/#jenkins-image)
